  <h2 class='c011'>THE GOLDEN TOUCH.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>There was once a king who was very
rich. His name was Midas. King
Midas loved gold better than anything
else in the world. There was nothing
he loved half so well except his little
daughter, Marygold. He thought, foolish
man, that the way to show this
love, was to get for her as much gold
as he could.</p>

<p class='c013'>Down deep under his castle, was a
small, dark room. In this room King
Midas kept his gold. Every day he
went there to look at it.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was always careful to lock the
door, so that no one could follow him.
This room was a very dreary place.
Only one little sunbeam ever thought
of peeping into it. King Midas loved
this little sunbeam, because his gold
could not shine without it.</p>

<p class='c013'>He used to put his treasure right
where the little ray would fall upon it.
Then he would play with the pieces of
gold, throwing them up and catching
them again. He had a large bowl of
solid gold. It was so bright that he
could see himself in it. He would sit
for hours and look at his face in this
rich mirror. Sometimes the face seemed
to be making fun of him. Then he
would lay it aside.</p>

<p class='c013'>Next, he would bring out his bags
of gold dust and let the dust run
through his fingers, as a child plays
with sand. He often said to himself:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, I wish I had the whole world
for my treasure-room, and full of gold
all my own; then I could be happy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>One day while he was looking at his
gold, he thought the sunbeam grew
larger. It seemed to fill the whole
room. The rays danced in the corners
like fairies. King Midas looked up.
There stood a beautiful young man
near the door. His face was so bright
that the king shaded his eyes with his
hands as he looked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are a very rich man, friend
Midas. With all this gold you ought
to be the happiest man in the world.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” said Midas, “I have done
very well; but it has taken almost a
lifetime to get this. Now, if I could
live a thousand years, I might get rich!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, haven’t you enough yet?”
asked the young man, opening his eyes
very wide.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No,” said Midas.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” said the stranger, “I should
like to know what would satisfy you.
Will you be kind enough to tell me?”</p>

<p class='c013'>The king thought for a time and
then said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“If I could have my way, everything
I touch would turn to gold.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Are you quite sure this would
satisfy you?” asked the young man.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure of it?” cried Midas. “Why
shouldn’t it satisfy me?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And are you sure you would never
be sorry you made such a wish?” said
the stranger.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How could I be sorry? I tell you I
should be the happiest man in the world.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Very well,” said the stranger, “to-morrow,
at sunrise, you will have the
Golden Touch.”</p>

<p><span class='small'>“IN THIS ROOM KING MIDAS KEPT HIS GOLD”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>When King Midas awoke the next
morning a little sunbeam shone on his
bed. He put out his hand and touched
the coverlet. It was changed to gold.
With a cry of joy he sprang from his
bed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hurrah! I have the Golden Touch,”
he cried.</p>

<p class='c013'>He ran about touching everything in
the room. Of course they all turned
to gold. Then he dressed himself and
was delighted to find that his clothes
had become beautiful garments of gold.
He put on his spectacles, but could not
see through them. Taking them off
and rubbing them he saw that the glass
had become plates of gold.</p>

<p class='c013'>As he went down stairs, he put his
hand on the railing. It turned to gold.</p>

<p class='c013'>He opened the door and went into
the garden. The roses were nodding
in the fresh morning breeze; the air
was filled with their sweet perfume.
But King Midas did not care for this.
What do you think he did? Why, he
changed everyone of those roses into
hard, shining gold. The dew drops
became diamonds.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then he went back to the house.
Breakfast was ready. Marygold had
not yet come in, so he had her called.
She always had bread and milk for her
breakfast. She ate it out of a beautiful
china bowl. This bowl had strange
trees and houses painted upon it. While
the father waited for her, he thought
he would change her bowl to gold.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That will please her,” thought he.</p>

<p class='c013'>Just then he heard her coming. The
door opened and she came in. She had
her apron to her eyes and was crying
as if her heart would break.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, what is the matter my dear
child?” asked the king.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, my beautiful roses! They are
all ugly and yellow,” cried she. “When
I try to smell them, their hard petals
prick my nose.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, dear, don’t cry about it. Sit
down and eat your bread and milk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They both sat down to the table. He
thought she would forget about the
roses, when she saw her golden bowl;
but she was too sad to notice it. Perhaps
it was best that she did not, for
she had always been so fond of looking
at the pictures upon it. These faded
as soon as the bowl was changed to
gold.</p>

<p class='c013'>His walk in the garden had given
the king a good appetite. His breakfast
of baked potatoes, fish, hot cakes
and coffee looked very good indeed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, this is nice,” he said, as he
poured out a cup of coffee. He smiled
when he saw the coffee pot turn to gold.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I shall soon have nothing but gold
on my table,” thought he, and began to
wonder where he could keep his
treasure.</p>

<p class='c013'>He raised the cup of coffee to his
lips. That, too, turned to gold. Of
course he could not drink it. He set
the cup down quickly. Marygold looked
up and asked,</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is the matter, father?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing, child, nothing,” said the
king.</p>

<p class='c013'>He thought he would try one of the
fish. As soon as he touched it, it became
hard and bright. Then he broke
one of the cakes. It became yellow
and heavy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t quite see how I am to get
any breakfast,” thought the king.</p>

<p class='c013'>He looked at Marygold. She was
quietly eating her bread and milk. How
he longed to have just one bite! What
good would all this gold do him, if he
could not eat anything?</p>

<p class='c013'>The potatoes looked so tempting that
he thought he would try again.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Perhaps I can swallow so quickly,
that a potato will not have time to
turn to gold,” thought he.</p>

<p class='c013'>Poor foolish Midas! He popped one
into his mouth, but it changed as soon
as he touched it. The hot gold burned
him so that he jumped up and cried
out with pain.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, what is the matter, dear
father?” cried Marygold. “Have you
burned yourself?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, my child,” said the king, “I
don’t know what is to become of your
poor father!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Marygold got down from her chair
and ran to him. By this time Midas
hated the very sight of gold. He felt
that Marygold was all he had to love
now. He took her in his arms and
kissed her.</p>

<p class='c013'>Oh, unhappy Midas! Marygold, too,
had become hard, shining gold. There
were the tears still on her cheeks;
they were little lumps of gold now.
Everything was the same, even the
pretty dimple in her chin.</p>

<p class='c013'>Poor Midas! His heart was almost
broken. He threw himself upon the
floor and tried to pray. The words
would not come.</p>

<p class='c013'>All at once the room grew very
bright. Midas raised his head. There
stood the stranger who had given him
the Golden Touch. His face was sad,
yet Midas thought he saw a smile there,
too, as he said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, friend Midas, how do you like
the Golden Touch?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hush!” cried the king. “I hate the
very name of gold!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, how is this?” asked the
stranger. “Have you not enough yet?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Enough!” cried the king. “Too
much! I wish I might never see gold
again. Gold is not everything. See,”
said he, pointing to Marygold. “I
would give all the gold in the world,
just to see her smile again.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are sure you have had enough
of the Golden Touch?” asked the
stranger.</p>

<p class='c013'>Midas’ look showed that he thought
the question a very foolish one.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Take a vase,” said the young man,
“and go to the river that runs by your
garden; jump head first into the river
and fill the vase with the water; then
put a few drops of it on anything you
have changed to gold. It will become
as it was before,” and the stranger was
gone.</p>

<p class='c013'>You may be sure the king lost no
time. He took a vase, and running to
the river, jumped in. As soon as he
touched the water his heart seemed to
grow light. He was glad to see the
vase become china again.</p>

<p class='c013'>He filled it and went quickly to the
house. The first thing he did was to
sprinkle a little water over Marygold.
As soon as it touched her, her cheeks
became pink and her blue eyes opened
wide.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why are you throwing water on
me, father?” she cried. “You will soil
my pretty dress.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The king said nothing. He did not
want her to know how foolish he had
been. He took her in his arms and
kissed her many times.</p>

<p class='c013'>While she went to put on another
dress, he took the vase into the garden
and put a few drops of water on each
flower. When Marygold came out she
was delighted to see them bowing to
her as if nothing had been wrong.</p>

<p class='c013'>The king did not stop until he had
put water on everything he had turned
to gold. Then he remembered that he
was very hungry. Never had he eaten
anything half so good as that breakfast.
He was a happy man now.</p>

<p class='c013'>Two things were left to remind him
of the Golden Touch. The sand in the
river sparkled like gold, and Marygold’s
hair, which had once been brown, now
had a tinge of gold. As this made her
more beautiful, Midas was not sorry.
He used to say it was the only gold he
cared for now.</p>

  <h2 class='c011'>LITTLE DAFFYDOWNDILLY.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>There was once a little boy whose
name was Daffydowndilly. Isn’t that a
pretty name? Well, Daffydowndilly
was a very pretty little boy. He had
bright blue eyes and his cheeks were
like roses, while his hair made one
think of spun gold.</p>

<p class='c013'>You think his name sounds like the
name of a flower? So it does. That
is why it was such a good name for
this little boy. He looked like a bright
flower. He often played in the meadows
all day long. He liked to do only
what was easy and pleasant.</p>

<p class='c013'>Daffydowndilly’s mother was very
kind to him. Her sweet face always
wore a smile for the little boy. Indeed,
I do not think he knew what a frown
was.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Daffydowndilly could not always
play. Like all little boys, he was soon
old enough to go to school, and then
was sent away from his pleasant home
to a school so many miles away, that
he had to stay there all the time. The
schoolmaster’s name was Mr. Toil.</p>

<p class='c013'>Daffydowndilly had never before seen
a face like Mr. Toil’s. There were such
deep lines in it. How he frowned on
the lazy boys! How harsh his voice
was when he spoke to them!</p>

<p class='c013'>Daffydowndilly had been at school
but a week when he said to himself, “I
don’t like to go to school. I’m afraid
of Mr. Toil. I don’t like to work. I
want to play. I’ll run away.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So the very next morning, Daffydowndilly
ran away. He had some
bread and cheese for his breakfast and
a little money in his pocket.</p>

<p class='c013'>How glad he was to get away from
school! He felt like a bird out of its cage.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had not gone far when he overtook
a man who, also, was walking.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good morning, my boy,” said the
stranger. “Where are you going so
early?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Now, Daffydowndilly had never told
a falsehood in his life and would not
tell one now. After looking at the
stranger for a moment he said,</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am running away from school because
I do not like the master. His
name is Mr. Toil, and oh, he is so cross!
I want to go where I shall never hear of
him again.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i021.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'>“I AM RUNNING AWAY FROM SCHOOL BECAUSE I DO NOT LIKE THE MASTER,” HE SAID</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, very well, my little friend,” said
the stranger. “We will go together. I,
too, know Mr. Toil, and should like to
find a place where he has never been
heard of.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This did not quite please Daffydowndilly.
He would like a little boy for
his companion much better. Then they
could stop and gather flowers or chase
butterflies. That would be so pleasant.
But he thought,</p>

<p class='c013'>“This man will know better which
way to go. He will take care of me
and keep me from harm.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So he trudged along with the stranger.
They had not gone far, when they
came to a field where men were at
work, cutting the tall grass. Then they
spread it out in the sun to dry.</p>

<p class='c013'>Daffydowndilly was delighted with
the sweet smell of the new-mown grass.
The sun shown down on the field. The
birds sang in the trees near by.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, how beautiful!” cried he. “Let
us stop and watch them. I wish I
might stay here always. How much
nicer it is here, than in that old school room.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Just then he saw something that
made him start back and catch his
companion’s hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Quick, quick!” cried he. “Let us
run away or he will catch us!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who will catch us?” asked the
stranger.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr. Toil, the old schoolmaster,”
answered Daffydowndilly. “Don’t you
see him in the field there?”</p>

<p class='c013'>He pointed to an old man who
seemed to be the owner of the field.
He had taken off his coat and was
working in his shirt sleeves. He did
not rest a moment. All the time he
kept saying,</p>

<p class='c013'>“Make hay while the sun shines, my
men.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Sure enough, he did look just like
Mr. Toil. His voice, too, was the same,
yet Mr. Toil must have been in the
school room at that time.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t be afraid,” said the stranger.
“This is not Mr. Toil, the schoolmaster.
It is one of his brothers. He is a farmer.
People say he is worse than the
schoolmaster. But he won’t trouble
you, unless you go to work on his
farm.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Daffydowndilly believed this, yet was
glad to get away. By-and-by they saw
some carpenters building a house.
Daffydowndilly wanted to stop again.
He loved to watch the men making
doors and putting in windows. How
neatly they did their work.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a pretty sight to see the shavings
roll from under the plane. They
looked like ribbons.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How nice it would be to have a
saw, a hammer, and a plane, and build
a little house for myself,” thought he.</p>

<p class='c013'>While he was thinking what fine fun
this would be, he saw something which
made him cry out,</p>

<p class='c013'>“Make haste. Quick, quick! There
he is again!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who?” asked the stranger.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Old Mr. Toil,” said Daffydowndilly.
“There! Don’t you see him among the
carpenters? That’s my old schoolmaster,
as sure as I live!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The stranger looked where he pointed.
He saw an old man with a carpenter’s
rule in his hand. He was
marking out the work to be done. All
the time he was telling the men to
work hard. And they sawed and hammered
and planed as if for their lives.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, no!” said the stranger, “this is
not Mr. Toil, the schoolmaster. It is
another brother of his. He is a carpenter.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m very glad to hear it,” said
Daffydowndilly. “But I’d like to get
out of his way as soon as I can.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So on they went. Soon they heard
the sound of a drum and fife. Daffydowndilly
knew there must be soldiers
coming.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let us make haste,” said he, “I want
to see the soldiers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They walked as fast as they could,
and soon met a company of soldiers.
They were gayly dressed, with beautiful
feathers in their caps and carried
bright guns on their shoulders.</p>

<p class='c013'>In front marched two drummers and
fifers. How they beat their drums and
played their fifes! What lively music
they made! Daffydowndilly thought he
would like to follow them to the end of
the world.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If I were a soldier,” he thought,
“Mr. Toil would never dare to look me
in the face.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Quick step! Forward march!”
shouted a gruff voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>Daffydowndilly started to run.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There he is again,” he cried. “I
know his voice.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Daffydowndilly pointed to the captain.
He was, indeed, the very image
of Mr. Toil. To be sure he wore a cap
and feather, and carried a sword instead
of a stick. But Daffydowndilly
was sure it was his old schoolmaster.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are mistaken again, my little
friend,” said the stranger. “This is not
Mr. Toil, the schoolmaster, but another
brother of his. He is a soldier and has
been in the army all his life. You and
I need not fear him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” said Daffydowndilly, “I’m
glad to hear it; but, if you please sir, I
don’t want to see the soldiers any
more.”</p>

<p class='c013'>On they went and, by-and-by, came
to a house by the roadside. They could
hear the sound of a fiddle within and,
through the open doorway could see
boys and girls dancing. They were
having a merry time. Daffydowndilly
thought he had never seen anything
half so pretty.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, let us stop here,” he said. “Mr.
Toil would never dare show his face
where there is music and dancing. We
shall be safe enough here.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Just then he looked at the fiddler.
Whom should he see again but old Mr.
Toil. He had a violin bow instead of
a stick, but looked exactly like the old
schoolmaster.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, dear me!” said Daffydowndilly,
turning pale. “Is there nobody but
Mr. Toil in the whole world! Who
would have thought he could play a
fiddle!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“This is not your old schoolmaster,”
said the stranger. “This is another
brother of his. He calls himself Mr.
Pleasure, but his real name is Toil.
Those who know him best, say he is
worse than any of his brothers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let us go a little farther,” said
Daffydowndilly. “I don’t like the looks
of this fiddler at all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So they went on through shady lanes
and pleasant villages. Everywhere the
sky was blue, the sun shone, and the
birds sang. But go where they would,
there was the image of old Mr. Toil.
Whether they stopped at a cottage or
a mansion, it was all the same. Sometimes
they found him in the parlor,
very often in the kitchen. He was sure
to be there somewhere.</p>

<p class='c013'>Daffydowndilly was very tired, and
seeing some men lying in a shady place
by the roadside, he cried,</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, let us sit down and rest. Mr.
Toil will never come here. He hates
to see people resting.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Just then he looked at one of the
men. He seemed to be the laziest of
all. Who should it be again, but the
very image of old Mr. Toil.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There is a very large family of these
Toils,” said the stranger. “This is another
one of the schoolmaster’s brothers.
He is a very idle fellow and does
nothing but have, what he calls, a good
time, but I think he has a harder time
than any of the others.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Daffydowndilly began to cry.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, take me back! Take me back!”
said he. “If there is nothing but toil
in the world, I may as well go back to
the school house!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, there it is,” said the stranger.
And, sure enough, there it was.</p>

<p class='c013'>You see they had been going in a
circle, instead of a straight line.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come, we will go back to school
together.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Something in the stranger’s voice
made Daffydowndilly look at him.
There, again, was the face of old Mr.
Toil! So the poor boy had been with
him all day, even while he was trying
so hard to get away from him.</p>

<p class='c013'>When he came to know the schoolmaster
better, he found that he was not
so bad, after all. And when he learned
his lessons well, the old schoolmaster’s
smile was almost as pleasant as was
that of his own mother.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
